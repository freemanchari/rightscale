===================

This cookbooks provides configuration management for nodes run on Rightscale.

Requirements
============

## Chef:

* Chef: 0.10.10+

## RightScale:

Most of the recipes need to be run on a RightScale-managed cloud instance aka RightScale Server. You may find some recipes useful for other environments.

## Cookbooks:

Depends on the following coookbooks

* collectd (for RightScale Monitoring)
* rest_connection (yet to be used)

See the `metadata.rb` file for the latest dependencies.

## Platforms:

The following platforms and versions are tested.

* Debian 7, 6
* Ubuntu 12.04, 10.04

The following platform families are supported in the code, and are
assumed to work based on the successful testing on Ubuntu and CentOS.

* CentOS 6, 5
# EL/RHEL 6, 5
